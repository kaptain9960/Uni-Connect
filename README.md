## Overview

<img width="1365" height="651" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f30e576-4dbe-4ea8-807c-fb41c1559fea" />


Uni-Connect is a full-stack web application that provides Nigerian university students and lecturers with a dedicated space for academic discourse. Unlike informal tools such as WhatsApp or Telegram, Uni-Connect organises discussions by department and course, preserves knowledge across academic sessions, and introduces a content verification system through peer upvoting and lecturer-endorsed answers.

The platform was developed as a final-year capstone project at the **Department of Computer Science, University of Nigeria, Nsukka**, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the award of a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Computer Science.

> **Supervisor:** Prof. C.N. Udanor, Department of Computer Science, UNN

## Architecture

The system follows Django's **Model-View-Template (MVT)** pattern across a three-tier architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Presentation Tier                                  │
│  HTML5 + CSS3 + Bootstrap 5 + Vanilla JS + Spline  │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┘
                     │ HTTP
┌────────────────────▼────────────────────────────────┐
│  Business Logic Tier                                │
│  Django Views · RBAC · Voting · Endorsement Logic  │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┘
                     │ Django ORM
┌────────────────────▼────────────────────────────────┐
│  Data Tier                                          │
│  SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod)                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
